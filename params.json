{"name":"CaptchaLess","tagline":"Chrome extension for autofilling captchas at USTC site and weibo.com.","body":"### Welcome to CaptchaLess.\r\nCaptchaLess is a chrome extension which is designed to autofill captcha at USTC sites, including http://\\*.mis.teach.ustc.edu.cn/\\*, http://\\*.yjs.ustc.edu.cn/\\*, http://\\*.epc.ustc.edu.cn/\\* . You can download CaptchaLess at [chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/captchaless/claimmbgfkbkkjdibcghloeibcifnodn).  \r\nThis extension is our final project of Video Technology class. Although most of students in class choose to do something more about research, we think it's much more interesting to do something practical. After finishing this project, we find that this utility can be quite useful and we already have students using it.   \r\n\r\n### Main Work\r\nIn this project, we have mainly three parts of works: \r\n 1. Server part based on django framework, the repo is <https://github.com/CaptchaLess/mysite>\r\n 2. Algorithm implement for captcha recognition\r\n 3. Front-end code for getting captcha image and autofilling the result\r\nYou can get source code for each part at github: [server](https://github.com/CaptchaLess/mysite), [algorithm](https://github.com/CaptchaLess/Algorithm), and [front-end code](https://github.com/CaptchaLess/CaptchaLess)\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project has three authors, we are Wang Yunfeng(@vra),Huang Zhihua(@hzh8311), Pu Junfu(@Jevin754).  \r\nYunfeng finish \r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
