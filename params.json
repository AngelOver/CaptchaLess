{"name":"CaptchaLess","tagline":"Chrome extension for autofilling captchas at USTC site and weibo.com.","body":"### Welcome to CaptchaLess.\r\nCaptchaLess is a chrome extension which is designed to autofill captcha at USTC sites, including http://\\*.mis.teach.ustc.edu.cn/\\*, http://\\*.yjs.ustc.edu.cn/\\*, http://\\*.epc.ustc.edu.cn/\\* . You can download CaptchaLess at [chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/captchaless/claimmbgfkbkkjdibcghloeibcifnodn).  \r\nThis extension is our final project of Video Technology class. Although most of students in class choose to do something more about research, we think it's much more interesting to do something practical. After finishing this project, we find that this utility can be quite useful and we already have students using it.   \r\n\r\n### Main Work\r\nIn this project, we have mainly three parts of works: \r\n 1. Server part based on django framework\r\n 2. Algorithm implement for captcha recognition\r\n 3. Front-end code for getting captcha image and autofilling the result  \r\n\r\nChrome extension get captcha image first in HTML DOM, and send data to server in the url, in the format of base64. In the back end, Django server read the url and decode it to image data, and then send it to recognition part to get the result. Finally the result send to front end in the format of Http Response.  \r\nYou can get source code for each part at github: [server](https://github.com/CaptchaLess/mysite), [algorithm](https://github.com/CaptchaLess/Algorithm), and [front-end code](https://github.com/CaptchaLess/CaptchaLess)  \r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project has three authors, we are Wang Yunfeng(@vra),Huang Zhihua(@hzh8311), Pu Junfu(@Jevin754).  \r\nYunfeng finish \r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
